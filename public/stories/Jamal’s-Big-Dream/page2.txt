Rain or shine, Jamal was there, perfecting his shots and working on his dribbles. The vibrant graffiti-covered walls around the court made it feel like a special place just for him. And as he practiced, he imagined the day he would step onto a professional court.

One sunny afternoon, as Jamal was lost in his training, a tall man approached. It was Mr. Carter, a former NBA player. With a kind smile, he offered to coach Jamal. Excitedly, Jamal accepted, knowing that with hard work and determination, his dream would come true.
