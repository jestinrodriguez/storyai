Ollie loved making friends and helping others in the garden. One sunny day, he decided to visit his friends, Lily the Lily Flower, Benny the Blueberry, and Rosie the Rose. The garden was vibrant and full of life, with colorful flowers blooming and tall green grass swaying in the breeze. Butterflies danced in the air, and little bees buzzed merrily from flower to flower.
