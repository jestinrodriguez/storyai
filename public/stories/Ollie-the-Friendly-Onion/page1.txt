Once upon a time in a quaint little garden, there lived an onion named Ollie. Ollie was round with a brown, papery exterior and a hint of purple on his skin. He had a cheerful, expressive face with big, lively green eyes and a small, gentle smile. Despite his kind nature, Ollie had one peculiar trait. Whenever he got too close to people, they started to cry—not because they were sad, but because that’s what onions do.
