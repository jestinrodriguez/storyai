As he held the feather, a soft voice echoed in his ears, "Believe in yourself, and you shall soar." The words filled Tommy with a bubbling sense of wonder. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and with his heart pounding, he began to feel lighter and lighter until his feet lifted off the ground. To his amazement, he was flying!

The village below looked like a patchwork quilt of colors, the trees like broccoli tops, and the rivers like silver ribbons winding through the land. The sky around him was a vast canvas of blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds that seemed close enough to touch. Tommy swooped and soared, the wind playing a merry tune in his ears.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Tommy gently floated back to the ground. He knew he would cherish this magical gift and use it wisely, always remembering the lesson he had learned: that with belief in oneself, anything is possible.
