Determined to learn, Jamie spent every free moment poring over the book. He practiced and practiced, making mistakes and learning from them. Eventually, Jamie discovered that by mastering coding, he could enhance his already formidable superhero abilities. He could now communicate with technology, fix broken machines, and even create new gadgets to help him protect the citizens of Technopolis.

One day, the evil Dr. Glitch attempted to take over the city by hacking all the digital systems. But Code Hero, with his newfound coding skills, was able to write a powerful program that neutralized Dr. Glitch's malicious code, saving the city from chaos.

The people of Technopolis cheered as Code Hero stood atop a skyscraper, his suit glowing brightly against the night sky. Jamie realized that the true superpower was knowledge, and from that day on, he dedicated himself to teaching others the wonders of coding.
